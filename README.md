Animations of CUDA GPU memory access patterns.
Runs in web browsers that support the HTML5 [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

The main goal of this project is to provide intuitive visualizations of the challenges related to data locality when programming CUDA-supported GPUs.
As a consequence, many relevant hardware-level details have been omitted in favor of simplicity.
